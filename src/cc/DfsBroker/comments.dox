/** @defgroup DfsBroker DfsBroker
 * Distributed File System Broker.
 * The DfsBroker module contains definitions for distributed filesystem broker
 * clients and servers.  The DfsBroker servers and client library are how the
 *  %Hypertable servers access the underlying filesystem and provides a layer
 *  of abstraction that allows %Hypertable to run on top of any filesystem.
